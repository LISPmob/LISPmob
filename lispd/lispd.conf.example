#                off -> LISP proxy routing capabilities disabled: PxTR
#   debug: Specify the amount of debugging information lispd will print. On
#     production systems, with a stable configuration this should be set to
#     0. When experimenting, debugging issues, or preparing useful bug
#     reports, the value should be raised gradually. When reporting bugs,
#     developers may ask a specific value to be configured and logs be sent.

#   map-request-retries: The number of additional Map-Requests to send if the
#     first one times out. The non-configurable timeout value is 2 seconds.
